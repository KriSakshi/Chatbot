🗨️ Intelligent Conversational Agent

Hi there! 👋
This is one of my learning projects where I built a chatbot using Python and the OpenAI API.
The chatbot runs in the terminal — you type something, and it gives an AI-powered response.


💡 Why I Built This

-As a computer science student, I wanted to:

-Understand how APIs work in real projects

-Learn how to keep sensitive information (like API keys) safe using .env

-Practice Python concepts like loops, file handling, and error handling.

-Build something small but practical that I can later improve (like adding a front-end)

-This project gave me hands-on experience with AI integration and     helped  me strengthen my basics in Python.


✨ Features
Interactive chatbot in the terminal
Uses GPT-3.5 Turbo for responses
Secure API key handling with .env
Lightweight & beginner-friendly


🚀 How to Run

1.Clone the repository
2.git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git
  cd chatbot
3.Set up virtual environment
4.python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
  venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
5.Install dependencies
  pip install -r requirements.txt
6.Add your OpenAI API key
  Create a .env file in the project folder and add:
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
7.Run the chatbot
  python chatbot.py


chatbot/
│── chatbot.py        # Main chatbot script
│── requirements.txt  # Project dependencies
│── .env              # Your API key (not uploaded to GitHub)
│── README.md         # Project documentation


🔒 Notes

I did not push my API key — it stays in .env.

Anyone who wants to use this project will need their own API key.

This is my starter project, but I plan to add more features (like a front-end) in the future. 🚀
